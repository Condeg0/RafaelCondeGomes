### Optimizing Credit Risk: A Profit-First Approach
![](Loan-Default-Prediction/LogReg-StrategyCurve.png) **Stack:** Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

**The Problem:** Standard default prediction models maximize accuracy (AUC) but often fail to maximize *profit*. A bank loses more money on a False Negative (default) than it gains from a True Negative (repayment).

**The Solution:**
I engineered a **Threshold Optimization Engine** that shifts the decision boundary based on the specific cost-benefit matrix of the loan portfolio.

* **Strategy:** Prioritized recall for high-risk segments to minimize costly defaults.
* **Result:** While raw accuracy remained comparable to baseline, the **risk-adjusted revenue** improved significantly by rejecting "borderline" applicants that standard models would have accepted.

### NYC Ride-Share Demand Analysis
![](./Uber-NYC-Analysis/NYC Uber Rise Map.png)

**Stack:** R (ggplot2, dplyr), Geospatial Analysis

**The Problem:**
Ride-sharing platforms face a "Cold Start" problem every day: Where should drivers position themselves *before* demand spikes? Inefficient positioning leads to higher wait times and lost revenue.

**The Solution:**
I conducted a spatiotemporal analysis of 4.5M+ Uber pickups to identify high-density clusters and temporal demand cycles.

* **Insight:** Identified a non-linear demand surge on Thursdays (not Fridays) suggesting commuter-heavy usage over nightlife.
* **Application:** These heatmaps serve as a proxy for "Pre-Surge" indicators for fleet management.
